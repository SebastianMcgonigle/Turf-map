Website Description:

Libraries and Hospitals

The website loads a base map of Calgary. There are icons showing the location of each school and hospital/clinic in the area. If the user hovers over a symbol with the mouse, a popup will show the name of the institution. When a user clicks on a school icon, a blue circle will automatically indicate which hospital/clinic is closest to that school. 

Thanks for checking out my website!
